## About

New Data Science Analyst working at Problem Forward. I am interested in data visualization and data analytics. 

I have studied Data Science using the Leek Group's Chromebook Data Science Program. I have a certificate from the completed course that helped me land my current position. I learned how to make shiny apps, flex dashboards, tidy untidy data, and collecting analyses for different sectors of the business world. 

I have worked with other fortune 500 companies that specialize in marketing anlytics, pharmecutical venders, lawyers, homeless drop-in centers, and biomedical sectors.
